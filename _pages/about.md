Currently working at the [AMT](amt.rwth-aachen.de/) as a Research Assistant (_Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter_). 

My field of research is currently Acoustic Emission (AE). There is probably some future research to come in the field of energy in the mining industry with a focus in the Zero emissions mining.

More info comming soon _I guess_
