Activate your environment\
```conda activate``` *```<env_name> ```* \
Get the path to your environment running\
```where python```
The output should be something like\
```C:\Users\```*```<user_name>```*```\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\python.exe``` \
or in the case of an environment:\
```C:\Users\```*```<user_name>```*```\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\envs\```*```<env_name>```*```\python.exe``` \

```CTRL+SHIFT+P``` to open **Preference: Open User Settings (JSON)**.
- User settings  globally in VSCode

Set the `python.condaPath` variable to the desired path
