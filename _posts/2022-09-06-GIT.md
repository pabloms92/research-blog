## Git Merge
Merging via command line

If you do not want to use the merge button or an automatic merge cannot be performed, you can perform a manual merge on the command line. However, the following steps are not applicable if the base branch is protected.

Step 1: Clone the repository or update your local repository with the latest changes.

```
git pull origin master
```

Step 2: Switch to the base branch of the pull request.

```
git checkout master
```

Step 3: Merge the head branch into the base branch.

```
git merge new-articles
```

Step 4: Push the changes.

```
git push -u origin master
```
